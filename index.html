                          <p> The KRN is an initiative at information and knowledge sharing that aims to enhance the public’s understanding of economic and financial concepts and issues, and thus empower them to contribute more meaningfully to economic development and benefit better from the opportunities that such development would bring. In partnership with libraries, the BSP will set up Knowledge Resource Collections that will house updated BSP publications such as books, reports, guides, manuals, primers and brochures, as well as provide access to online publications and research assistance services to the public.  These information resources and services will be made available to the local communities for free.</p>
                          <p> BSP envisions KRN to be a catalyst for economic development by empowering the public to make informed and better economic and financial decisions through easy access to information and services.  </p>

                              <p> Science and technology information is vast and numerous locally and globally. It encompasses and applies to many fields of study. Not many people realize that we live and breathe science and technology everyday—it is in the things we encounter day by day, it is in us. The Science and Technology Information Institute (STII) of the Department of Science and Technology is mandated by virtue of Executive Order 128 on January 30, 1987 generally to promote science and technology information in the country and accomplishes this by maintaining a physical library and producing multi-media promotions (print and video). </p>
